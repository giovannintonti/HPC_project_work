 * Provide a parallell version of the Tarjan's algorithm to find Strongly Connected Components in a Graph. 
 * The implementation MUST use an hibrid  message passing / shared memory paradigm. and has to be implemented by using MPI and openMP.  
 * Students MUST provide parallel processes on different nodes, and each process has to be parallelized by using Open MP (i.e.: MPI will spawn OPENMP-compiled processes). 
 * Students can choose the graph allocation method the prefer. They can eventually produce the graph directly in distributed memory (without store anything).
 * 
 *  This file is the sequential version of Tarjan algorithm to find strongly connected components

/** @brief Function that finds the strongly connected components (SCCs) of a given graph and save them on a file
* @param v is the current vertex being processed
* @param graph is the array of vertices representing the graph
* @param stack is the stack used for Tarjan's algorithm
* @param curr_index is a pointer to the current index being used for Tarjan's algorithm
* @param fp is the file pointer for printing the SCCs to a file
* This function uses Tarjan's algorithm to find the strongly connected components (SCCs) of a given graph and writes the result to a file. 
* It sets the current vertex's index and low_link values and pushes it to the stack. 
* Then it iterates through the vertex's neighbors, updating their index and low_link values recursively if they haven't been visited yet
* or updating the current vertex's low_link if they are in the stack. If the current vertex's index is equal to its low_link, it pops elements from the stack and prints them
* to the file until it reaches the current vertex.*/
