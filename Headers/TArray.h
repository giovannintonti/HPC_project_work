 * Provide a parallell version of the Tarjan's algorithm to find Strongly Connected Components in a Graph. 
 * The implementation MUST use an hibrid  message passing / shared memory paradigm. and has to be implemented by using MPI and openMP.  
 * Students MUST provide parallel processes on different nodes, and each process has to be parallelized by using Open MP (i.e.: MPI will spawn OPENMP-compiled processes). 
 * Students can choose the graph allocation method the prefer. They can eventually produce the graph directly in distributed memory (without store anything).
